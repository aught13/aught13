I'm a coding hobbiest dabbling in php. I know enough to get me into trouble. 
I've worked with code in some small form since 1986 and I'm expirenced in C, Visual Basic, javascript, php, and VBA

I'm currently working with the fuelphp framework for the racerhistory.com website and Office VBA projects for my day job

I'm interested in furthering the development of the fuelphp framwork
